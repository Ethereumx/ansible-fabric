# Ansible Fabric Starter
This project contains playbooks and roles for deployment of Hyperledger Fabric project on multiple instances. 

Everything is running inside docker-containers, and managed by `docker-compose`. Assumed that 1 physical (or virtual) host will serve one organisation, so **only multi-host deployment is supported** by this tool.
 
## Quick overview:
* Hyperledger Fabric v2.2.2
* TLS enabled on all configurations
* etcdraft orderer cluster
* CouchDB and LevelDB peer database supprted
* Configurable amount of organisations
* Configurable amount of channels
* 1 chaincode per channel
* Build-in hyperledger fabric explorer
* Build-in Fablo RestAPI

## Changelog:

From previous version, based on the use on Hyperledger Fabric v1.4.8:

* Hyperledger Fabric updated to version 2.2.2, and fabric-tools updated to 0.4.15;
* Added Prometheus and Grafana for Fabric host monitoring;
* Changed from Altoros REST to Fablo REST API for Fabric v2.x
* Changed the way of installing chaincode, following the Fabric v2 instructions (now, chaincode must be approved, etc. Please see inventory file updates).


## Technical Requirements:
Your machine should have:
* GNU/Linux operating system

## Instructions

#### How can I clone this repositry?

```git clone https://github.com/agustinustheoo/ansible-fabric-starter.git```

#### How should I configure my blockchain network?

   ![alt hosts_raft](docs/hosts_raft.png "hosts_raft.yml")
- **hosts_raft.yml** - EtcdRaft orderer, 4 organizations, each organization has own copy of orderer-service. 2 private channels between first three organizations.

If blockchain network architecture is pre-configured (or you may want to run default settings), 
you just need to specify ip-address of each host in `ansible_host`, user with sudo access in `ansible_user`. 
`domain` and machine domain-name (e.g. `one.example.com`) is mainly required for docker network, so you can set values you need.

Let's describe the `hosts_raft.yml` configuration:
```yaml
---
all:
  hosts:
    localhost: # localhost connection parameters, used for storing configuration while transferring it between nodes
      ansible_connection: local
  vars:
    global_domain: example.com
    global_chaincode_lang: golang # Programming language of chaincode
    global_chaincode_version: 1.0 # Your chaincode version
    global_channels:
      - name: common # Channel name
        particapants: # Organizations, should be included in channel
          - org0
          - org1
        chaincode: # Chaincode params
          name: chaincode
          filename: chaincode
          version: "{{ global_chaincode_version }}"
          policy: ""
          init: '{"Args":["init","a","100","b","100"]}'
    orderer_count: 2 # Amount of orderers in network
  children:
    nodes:
      hosts:
        org0.example.com: # Describes which containers will run on this node
          node_roles:
            - root_orderer # This node will be used to generate crypto-config for other orderers
            - orderer # This node will host an orderer-service
            - peer # This node will host peers and api containers for organization
            - root_peer # This node will be used to create channels and instantiate chaincode
            - explorer # This node will serve hyperledger fabric explorer
            - monitoring # This node will serve hyperledger fabric monitoring
          org: org0 # Organization name
          org_id: 0
          orderer_id: 0
          ansible_host: 10.0.3.38 # Real ip address or domain name of the machine
          ansible_user: ubuntu  # User with sudo access
          # ansible_private_key_file: ~/.ssh/id_rsa # Private key to identify ourselves
          ansible_ssh_port: 22 # Specify ssh-port here, if case of it's not defaulted.
        # Same structure for any other nodes
        org1.example.com:
          node_roles:
            - orderer # This node will host an orderer-service
            - peer # This node will host peers and api containers for organization
            - explorer
          org: org1
          org_id: 1 # ID of orderer-service which is running on this host
          orderer_id: 1 # ID of orderer-service which is running on this host
          ansible_host: 10.0.3.236 # Real ip address or domain name of the machine
          ansible_user: ubuntu  # User with sudo access
          # ansible_private_key_file: ~/.ssh/id_rsa # Private key to identify ourselves
          ansible_ssh_port: 22
```
Feel free, to fulfill each host with any ansible-related connection details you need, like `ansible_private_key_file`. You can read about ansible inventory [here](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html).

Adjust additional network configuration like _ports_, or _chaincode parameters_ for each node in `group_vars/all.yml`.

#### How do I launch deployment?

**Please note, that every new deployment configured to delete existing docker volumes and containers. That means, if you redeploy on working system, all data will be lost.**

First, ensure that you are in project-root directory:

```bash 
cd ansible-fabric-starter
```

If your instances are debian-based (having apt package manager) you can automatically install python3 via:

```bash
ansible-playbook install-python.yml -i hosts_raft.yml
```

By default ansible inventory is located in hosts.yml file. You can rename any configuration from example, or specify correct inventory via `-i` parameter.
If deployment is performed for the first time, you may want to install all dependencies like docker etc.:

```bash 
ansible-playbook install-dependencies.yml -i hosts_raft.yml
```

Or if you'd like to keep your inventory configuration in `hosts.yml`:

```bash
ansible-playbook install-dependencies.yml
```

After all the nodes are provisioned with all the necessary software, you can deploy the blockchain network to the configured instances:

```bash
ansible-playbook config-network.yml -i hosts_raft.yml
```

_hint:_ _`config-network.yml` will include `start-network.yml` automatically._

If you'd like to redeploy network without reconfiguration, to drop the ledger for example, just launch `start-network.yml` (don't forget inventory configuration).

#### How to deploy hyperledger explorer?

1) Deploy network with ansible fabric starter.
2) Execute start-explorer.yml playbook like `ansible-playbook start-explorer.yml -i <your inventory file>`

#### How to perform chaincode upgrade?

1) Put new chaincode sources in `templates/chincode`
2) Update chaincode version in inventory file or pass as env var via '-e' ansible paramter.
3) Execute chaincode-upgrade.yml playbook like `ansible-playbook chaincode-upgrade.yml -i <your inventory file> '-e global_chaincode_version=2.0'`

Playbook will perform chaincode upgrade when `chaincode_version` you specified differs from installed chaincode version.

#### How do I test deployed network?

After successful deployments you can use testing scripts, which will invoke chaincode on peers via cli containers.

* *test.yml* will invoke chaincode in common channel.
* *test_bilateral.yml* will invoke chaincode in bilateral channel.

All test data should specified in 'set_facts' task of `test.yml` and `test_bilateral.yml` playbooks:

```yaml
- name: Set chaincode invoke content
  set_fact:
    chaincode_update_json: '{"Args":["move", "a", "b", "10"]}' #cc invoke args
    chaincode_query_json: '{"Args":["query", "a"]}'
    invoke_channel_name: "common" # channel, where chaincode will be called
```
Launching test playbooks is like any other ansible playbooks:

```bash
ansible-playbook test.yml -i hosts_raft.yml
```

#### How to access blockchain explorer?

1) Open `8080` port of instance with explorer role.
2) Login with credentials specified in `group_vars/all.yml`, `admin`/`adminpw` by default.

### Maintenance scripts

Ansible-fabric-starter will create scripts for starting and stopping each node, because docker containers configured in a way, to start network at system start up. (`restart_ploicy: always`)

So, if you'd like to turn network off and on, there are shell scrips

* `start-network.sh`
* `stop-network.sh`

They are generated in `fabric_starter_workdir`.

## Configurations & design description

Ansible will connect each specified node using ssh, and execute all necessary tasks to deploy network from scratch. 
Creditionals, hosts ip-addresses, kafka-cluster (if needed), HL fabric channels should be defined in `hosts.yml` for each host.
HL-specific parameters like services ports, chaincode name and version, project home should be defined at `group_vars/all.yml`

### Static files and templates:
All templates located in `templates` folder.
* **artifact-templates** - contains hyperledger fabric configuration files.
* **docker-compose-templates** - contains templates for docker.
* **chaincode** - contains chaincode source code, should be placed in go/$your_chaincode_name/$your_chaincode_name.go

`www-client` folder should contain all files, which will be mapped by docker to document_root web server directory. 
Please note, that by default it's only transferred to target hosts, so you need to edit `docker-compose-templates/base.yaml` to map directory in docker container. 

### Included ansible roles description:

* **common-packages** - installs jq, python3-pip, rsync and docker-python (python libs for docker) on target hosts.
* **docker** - installs docker and docker-compose on target hosts. [Docker Ansible-galaxy role](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-docker)
* **fabric** - pulls all necessary Hyperledger-fabric Docker images.

### Playbooks description:

##### **install-dependencies.yml**

Calls mentioned earlier roles, to install all necessary software and prepare target hosts for deployment.

##### **config-network.yml**

Generates HL fabric and Docker-compose configuration-files from templates and transfers them to target hosts.
    
1. Deletes any existing configuration of HL-fabric and Docker-containers. (all described nodes, including localhost)
2. Templates all configs, specified in `group_vars/all.yml`:

    Docker config files:

        2. docker-compose-{{ org }}.yaml (final docker-compose config-file)
        
    HL-fabric config files:
        
        1. configtx.yaml   
        2. fabric-ca-server-{{ org }}.yml
        3. cryptogen-{{ org }}.yaml

3. Transfers chaincode source-code from `templates/chaincode`

        1. docker-compose-{{ global_domain }}.yaml
    
    HL-fabric:
        
        1. cryptogen-{{ global_domain }}.yaml

9. Generates crypto material with HL cryptogen tool, using container `cli` and configuration file `cryptogen-{{ global_domain }}.yaml`.
10. Generates orderer genesis block with configtxgen tool,  using container `cli`.
11. Generates config transaction (.tx) files for `common` and all specified in `hosts.yml` channels with configtxgen tool, using container `cli`.
12. Synchronizes all configuration files generated by orderer to other nodes.

#### **start-network.yml** 

Creates all channels and starts blockchain network.
    
1. Synchronizes www-client content to all nodes, this will be mapped to `api` container by docker, to serve web-client application.
2. Synchronizes `docker-compose-zookeeper.yaml` and `docker-compose-kafka-broker.yaml` (if specified).
3. Starts kafka-cluster according configuration, with `docker-compose-zookeeper.yaml` and `docker-compose-kafka-broker.yaml` (if specified).
4. Starts orderer docker conainers with docker-compose and `docker-compose-{{ global_domain }}.yaml` config file:
    * orderer{{ orderer_id | default() }}.{{ global_domain }} (fabric orderer service)
    * cli.{{ global_domain }} (fabric command line interface)
5. Starts peer docker conainers with docker-compose and `docker-compose-{{ org }}.yaml` config file:

7. Installs chaincode to common and all other specified channels, using `cli` container.
8. Creates common and all other specified channels, using `cli` container of root_peer.
9. Synchronizes all configuration files generated by orderer to other nodes.
10. Joins root_peer to common and all other specified channels, using `cli` container.
11. Instantiating chaincode on common and all other specified channels, using `cli` container of root_peer.
12. Joins all other nodes to common and all other specified channels, using their `cli` container.

#### **add-new-org.yml** 

An experimental playbook designed to add new organizations and channels to running network, previously deployed with 
`ansible-fabric-starter` in `raft-orderer` mode.
To add new orgs/channels to your running network, you should have access to all of the network instances and hosts.yml inventory file network was deployed.

Modify your inventory file in a following way: __(Example configuration can be found in hosts_new_org.yml)__

1. Define a `newcomers` variable, for all of the nodes.
2. Add new organization names in all need existing channels.
3. Define new channels in `new_channels` variable.
4. Increase amount of orderers, according to the new size of your network.
5. Define all new organizations with `peer` and a `newcomer` flags.
6. Install all dependencies on the new machione: `ansible-playbook install-dependencies.yml -i hosts_new_org.yml`
7. Run deployment on testing environment with `ansible-playbook add-new-org.yml -i hosts_new_org.yml`

#### **chaincode-upgrade.yml** 

Playbook, to perform chaincode upgrade on previously launched network via Ansible-Fabric-Starter.

1. Transfers new chaincode sources to each of the nodes;
2. Spins up cli containers;
3. Checks, if new chaincode version != old chaincode version;
4. Performs chaincode upgrade.

### *node_roles* hostvar description

`node_roles` is special configuration variable of array type to simplify understanding of what type of containers each host will serve.
Depending on a "role", each node will receive it's specific docker containers and configuration.

All possible node roles:
* **orderer** - node will run orderer service
* **root_orderer** - this orderer will be used to generate configs for other orderers (in case of kafka multi-orderer setup, one role per network)
* **root_peer** - node will be used to create all channels and instantiate chaincode for the whole network (one role per network)
* **peer** - node will peer and api container for specified organization.
* **explorer** - node will serve Hyperledger Blockchain explorer, served port and explorer version configurable in 'group_vars/all.yml'.

#### Known issues

* Each playbook contains cleaning tasks for docker containers. If there are nothing to clean, cleaning tasks may be failing, that should be ignored.
